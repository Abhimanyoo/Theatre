# Theatre

Pet project using a simple version of Clean Architecture + MVVM + Reactive Extensions and Android Architecture Components.</br>
The data is fetched from [LondonTheatreDirect API](https://developer.londontheatredirect.com/).</br>
The main purpose is using the latest practices and libraries.

## Architecture

Uses concepts of the notorious Uncle Bob's architecture called [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

### Layers

</p>

* View
* View Model
* Use Case
* Entity
* Gateway
* Repository

### Data

The **LondonTheatreDirect API** groups the data into:

* __System API:__
_Obtain information about enum data types._

Since the data is basically static, a Repository with database caching is used by Gateway.

* __Inventory API:__
_Obtain realtime information about events on sale, venues, prices and availability._

Due the data volatility, it is used a Repository that caches in memory.
